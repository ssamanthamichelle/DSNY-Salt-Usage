# DSNY-Salt-Usage

Link to Data: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dsny-salt-use-by-day-2015-2017

This dataset aims to record the amount of salt used by each borough on a given day of a storm from 2016 through 2019. It is difficult to measure such a large amount accurately, so the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) records the number of times a piece of salt-spreading equipment reloads and multiplies that by the capacity of a piece of salt-spreading equipment which is 16 tons.
